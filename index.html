            <h2>Bri and Josh are getting married<br>on October 17, 2015.</h2>

            <hr>

            <h2 id="story">Our Story</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Do you remember how you met your sweetie? At a bar? At a Knicks game? At school? At the local library? Well for Bri and Josh, it was what modern-age historians call a "true testament to millennial age dating in our data-driven world."</p>

                <p>
                    <img src="images/josh_behind.jpg" alt="We are standing and smiling here">
                </p>

                <p>That's right, Bri and Josh met on the Internet! It wasn't long before the two stopped emailing, met in real life, had one beer, shook hands, and then said "Ok bye now."</p>
                <p>It must have been fate that the two Office-fanatic, dog-loving, advertising-employed, comedy heroes met online, in whatever way fate means in that scenario. They had much in common and decided to make it official a few months later.</p>

                <h3>Getting Serious: A Podcast is Born</h3>

                <p>
                    They say, "You know love is for real when you start recording 45-minute-to-hour-long podcasts and posting them to the Internet for everyone to listen."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bri and Josh took that old adage to heart and started <a href="http://abovethefoldpodcast.com"><em>Above the Fold Podcast</em></a>, one of the world's premier hybrid comedy/marketing podcasts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you go back and listen to old episodes, you will hear about various trips they took and things they did. But mostly, you'll hear about TV shows and various marketing topics.
                </p>

                <h3>Secret Trips: A Tale of Two Families</h3>

                <p>
                    Josh decided he'd had enough. It was time to seal the deal. He would take the necessary steps to acquire Bri as his legal property in exchange for a <em>dowry</em> (two small mules and a sack of feed, a common trade in Indian culture).
                </p>

                <p>
                    He first spoke to his parents about the arrangement. They said, "Good for you," and his mother (a marriage counselor by trade) offered some helpful advice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Josh bought a ring. The ring people weren't actually that helpful, but he found one pretty quickly. They were happy to sell it to him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Josh then arranged a secret visit to Bri's parents in Iowa City. On a Monday night, he drove to Iowa City and sat down for lasagna with Tom and Roxanne Boysen. Making them aware of his intentions, Josh received their blessing. He also realized that he would not, after all, be receiving two small mules and a sack of feed, because it was the year 2014, and he lived in America.
                </p>

                <h3>"LINES!!!": A Script of Love</h3>

                <p>
                    Later that week, after working up some courage and returning the unused bedding he'd put together for the mules, Josh decided it was time to pop the question. It was a Friday night &mdash; the 10th of October, 2014. Josh put on his finest polo shirt, and Bri her finest sweatpants. She thought they would simply be making chicken and filming some sketches in her apartment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When Josh arrived, however, things were different. He had with him a screenplay &mdash; well, an assortment of scenes from various screenplays. Included were scenes from their favorite TV shows and movies: <em>The Office</em>, <em>Parks and Recreation</em>, and <em>Bridesmaids</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After Bri read through the script, Josh got down on one knee and proposed. Because that's what you do in these situations. And that was that!
