                <p>Do you remember how your meet your sweetie? At a bar? At a Knicks game? At school? At the local library? Well for Bri and Josh, it was what modern-age historians call a "true testament to millennial age dating in our data-driven world."</p>

                <p>That's right, Bri and Josh met on the Internet! It wasn't long before the two stopped emailing, met in real life, had one beer, shook hands, and then said "Ok bye now."</p>
                <p>It must have been fate that the two Office-fanatic, dog-loving, advertising employed, comedy heroes met online, in whatever way fate means in that scenario. They had much in common and decided to make it official a few months later.</p>

                        We will stand in a church and become married.

                        Please stand in an orderly line as both Bri and Josh exit the church. One (1) clap from each attendee is not only allowed but encouraged.

                        Webster's Dictionary defines <em>reception</em> as "a mechanism for determining how much signal one has on a mobile telecommunications device." We wouldn't have it any other way.
